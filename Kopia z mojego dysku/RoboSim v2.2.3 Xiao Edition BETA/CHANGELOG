CHANGELOG for RoboSim, 2014

2.0.2: 
   - Handle reception of a non-unicode character on the control
     connection by closing the connection rather than throwing an
     uncaught exception and crashing.

2.0.3:
   - implement random underreads
   - Set SO_REUSE_ADDR on control socket to avoid timewait
   - poll control connection more often (was only 30 ops/sec, now around 120).

2.0.4:
   - increase max command rate to 150 ops/sec.
   - now also calculate the encoder values 150 times/sec
   - fix bug that resulted in motor speeds taking longer than they
     should to settle to target speed.
2.2.0 Xiao Edition:
   - Allowed for maximising Window
   - Cleaned up UI
   - Allowed the robot to be controlled with WASD or arrow keys if the joystick is not enables
   - Robot can be put into reset by pressing Space
   - created a config.cfg file, so that the settings for the colour of set_point and log_trail will persist between openings
   - changed zoom parameters so that min zoom is 2
   - allowed set_point and log_trail to have their colour changed
   - increased the file picker dialog so less scrolling
   - cleaned up simultation preferences dialog
   - added switches so that log_trail and set_point can be displayed or not
