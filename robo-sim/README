The simulator has been developed using python 2.7.  It should probably
run with any python 2.x version, but will probably not run on python
3.x.  It might be possible to make it run on python 3.x, but this
isn't a priority at the moment.

You'll also need to install pygame, available from:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

If you have python 2.7 installed in your path as python2.7, you can run the
simulator from the command line by running:
./RoboSim

Otherwise the incantation is something like
python2.7 RoboSim
or
python RoboSim
if python 2.7 is your default version.

On MacOS, if you've installed the 32-bit version of pygame, you may need to run Robosim as:
python-2.7-32 RoboSim
or edit the first line of RoboSim to specify this version of python.

One the simulator is running, you can drive manually using the buttons
at the top of the window.  

The simulator will also listen for incoming connections on TCP port
55443.  Robot software should connect to TCP port 55443 and issue
commands as described in the robot manual.

There are a number of scenery files in the scenery directory.  Use the
"Load" button to load the scenery file - you can do this while the
robot is driving, but it's probably better to load the correct scenery
file before starting the robot software.
